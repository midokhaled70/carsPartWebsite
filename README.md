index.html       # Main HTML file with all content and embedded JavaScript
````

## üì¶ Dependencies

* **Tailwind CSS CDN** ‚Äì for utility-first responsive design
* **[SheetJS (XLSX.js)](https://cdn.sheetjs.com/)** ‚Äì expected to be used but not included (you'll need to add the library if using `.xlsx` functionality)

**Note:** For the `loadFileData(filename)` function to work with `.xlsx` files, ensure you load `XLSX.js` in the `<head>`:

```html
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/xlsx/0.18.5/xlsx.full.min.js"></script>
```

## üß† How It Works

### 1. Navigation & Layout

* Uses Tailwind CSS utility classes for layout and styling.
* Fixed navigation header with toggleable mobile menu.
* Smooth scrolling between sections using anchor tags and JavaScript.

### 2. XLSX File Parser

The JavaScript function `loadFileData(filename)` handles `.xlsx` files by:

* Reading the base64-encoded file
* Parsing the first sheet using SheetJS
* Automatically detecting and filtering out empty rows
* Extracting a heuristic-based header row
* Converting to CSV for display or processing

### 3. Interactivity

* Menu toggle for mobile
* Scroll animation for anchor links
* Mobile menu hides after selection
